  <h5> Hi, I am Dellina Gebrehiwot. I am from Eritrea and was born in Las
  Vegas, Nevada. Then I moved to Seattle, WA. I visited Eritrea when I was
  around 9 and it was an amazing experience and I hope to go again. <br> <br>

  Fun Fact: <br>
  There has been a prolonged political and economic war between the
  Ethiopia and Eritrea government that has lasted 20 years. Until July 8, 2018 were the two
  countries unitied and became peaceful. The Eritrean and Ethiopian people and
  government have re-established trade and border conflicts resulting to airports traveling
  from either country reuniting several families back together and allowing thousands of
  active soilders to go back home.

  <h5> I am most excited to enter my senior year this year and end the 4 year high school journey.
  I also am apart of running start and joined my junior year and will continue it throughout
  my senior year. During my freshman and sophomore year I went to Mountlake Terrace High School
  and then transfered to Lynnwood High School my junior year. It's been a great and fun change as
  I am able to see more of my friends. I also have 1 older sister and 2 younger
  siblings. Somethings I enjoy are traveling and getting to explore and learn new things.
  Throughout the summer I decided to do
   <!DOCTYPE html>
  an internship with
  <a href = "https://girlswhocode.com/"> Girls Who Code. </a>
  The program has been very fun and has allowed me to gain more information about
  computer science and coding.<br><br>
