    { About Me }
  </h1>

  <h4> Hi, I am Dellina Gebrehiwot. I am from Eritrea and was born in Las
  Vegas Nevada, then I moved to Seattle WA. I visited Eritrea when I was
  around 9 and it was an amazing experience and I hope to go again. There has
  been an extreme and tragic political and economic war between Ethiopia and Eritrea
  that has lasted 20 years. Until July 8, 2018 were the two countries unitied
  and became peaceful. The Eritrean and Ethiopian people and government have
  came together and have allowed our airports to travel to both countries which
  united several families and brought those in the army home.

  my junior year and will continue it throughout my senior year. I also have

  getting to explore and learn new things. Throughout the summer I decided to do

  an internship with
  <a href = "https://girlswhocode.com/"> Girls Who Code. </a>
  The program has been very fun and has allowed me to gain more information about
  computer science and coding

  Some cool things I like are:
    Traditional Eritrean coffee
    Going to the beach
    Traveling
    Watching the sunset
